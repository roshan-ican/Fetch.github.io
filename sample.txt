We may feel like we are down and worthless
and that we cannot do anything great
the place we want reach seems far away,
but so struggle seems unbearable but it's all worth
cause there's no shortcut in life and we are not in
control of our lives, Everything happens by Allah(swt)
will we are just the puppets of his...
